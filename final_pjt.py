    A subclass of Player that represents a computer-controlled player in the game. 
    The computer player makes decisions based on its health, attack power, and healing 
    power, as well as the state of the opponent's health.

    Attributes:
        hp (int): Current health of the computer player.
        max_hp (int): Maximum health of the computer player.
        attack_power (int): The attack power of the computer player.
        heal_power (int): The healing power of the computer player.
        type (str): The type of the player (not directly used in ComputerPlayer, but inherited from Player).
    
    Methods:
        __init__(self, name, hp, max_hp, attack_power=0, heal_power=0):
            Initializes a ComputerPlayer instance with the given attributes.

            Determines the next action the computer player should take based on its own state

            kill, and healing needs.

        Determines the action the computer player should take on its turn.

        The decision-making logic considers:
        - If the computer playerneeds to go into panic mode (health is below a certain threshold), 
          it will try to heal if possible.
        - If the computer player is able to win with its attack, it will choose to attack.
        - If the computer player needs to be healed, it will prioritize healing.
        - Otherwise, it chooses the best action (either attack or heal) based on available power.

            opponent (Player): The opponent player object that the computer player faces.
